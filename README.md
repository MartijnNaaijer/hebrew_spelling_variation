# hebrew_spelling_variation
Data and analysis of spelling variation in MT, biblical DSS and SP.

The preprocessing pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. Uniformize data from different Hebrew sub-corpora (MT, DSS and SP) using classes in data_classes.py.
2. Parse the vowel letters in the MT (parse_matres_mt.py).
3. Parse vowel letters in DSS.
